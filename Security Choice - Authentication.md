# Authentication methhod choice | Date: 13/10/25

## Context and Problem Statement
The chosen tech stack will be revolded around using ASP.NET. We need to research the best method to implementing authentication. This is important for the proof of concept I am building since rather then a integrated login system, given we have planned for the login system to be
an external portal from a company website it is more important for a test token to be sent from them which we can link to our system to know both the user and company connected. 
Authentication is integral throughout the system to be multi tenant
