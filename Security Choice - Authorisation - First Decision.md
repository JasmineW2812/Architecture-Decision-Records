# Choosing best method for authorisation | Date: 13/10/25

## Context and Problem Statement
For the Complaint Management System we need to consider how users will access the system. There are multiple types of users which has different functionalities and should only have information shared to them necessary for what they want to do.
This is a key choice to consider as it will help to follow the data regulations. For the proof of concept we will have an admin, help desk agents (company employee) and consumer. Further implementations would have a help desk manager which can overlook some of the operations therefore
would need more permissions.

The problem is finding the most suited method for restricting parts of the system to follow data guidlines
